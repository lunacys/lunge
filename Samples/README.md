## Samples Description

There are some default samples that are always in the repo and show engine features. Order of the game engine version iterations:

```[DepTest] -> LibOnly -> Develop -> Nightly -> Release```

*DepTest* is not necessary as all the dependencies tests might be done already.

### Release

A ready-to-go game. An update of this sample means a new major iteration.

### Nightly

Nightly builds of the game engine and any other connected libraries are tested and showed in this project. This project is nearly stable and well done.

### Develop

Highly unstable game engine tests that may not work and even build at all.

### LibOnly

Library-only tests. Uses way default way MonoGame provides to develop a game. 

### DepTest

Dependencies tests.
